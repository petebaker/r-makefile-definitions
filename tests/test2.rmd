# Generic Introduction

**R**, *STATA*, __SPSS__, _SAS_ and most other statistical and database packages
access data via variable names. These names don't include spaces
because this would make programming very difficult indeed.  As such,
variable names aren't very nice to look at when printing tables or
producing plots. Most packages therefore provide a way of labelling
variables when producing output. While these variable labels are
called different things in most packages these are linked to variable
names without user intervention.

# Demo of simple R

```{r foo, echo = TRUE}
sessionInfo()
z <- 1+1
```

z is `r z`

And now for a plot.

```{r bar}
hist(rnorm(1000))
```
